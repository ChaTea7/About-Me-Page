        <h2><a href="career.html">Career Goal</a></h2>
        <p>
            I am currently a sophomore at Emerald High School with a burning passion for pursuing a career in STEM.  
            I aim to explore innovative ways to solve real-world problems through technology and scientific advancements. 
            To achieve this, I plan to continue excelling in my science and math courses while taking on leadership 
            roles in clubs that foster creativity and critical thinking.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="strengths.html">Strengths and Experience</a></h2>
        <p>
            As a co-founder of both the Chemistry Club and Physics Club at Emerald High School, I have developed leadership and organizational 
            skills by bringing together students with shared interests in science. My prior experience with Science Olympiad 
            has equipped me with the knowledge and discipline necessary to succeed in these roles. These experiences have strengthened 
            my ability to collaborate effectively and think critically.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="achievements.html">Achievements and Skills</a></h2>
        <p>
            Through my involvement in these clubs, I have gained hands-on experience with scientific concepts beyond the classroom. 
            I have successfully organized events such as guest speaker sessions and lab experiments, which have helped me refine my communication 
            and teamwork skills. Academically, I achieved a <span class="detail">3.96 GPA</span> at Fallon Middle School, earning Honor Roll every semester. 
            Last year, I achieved a <span class="detail">4.00 Cumulative GPA</span>, reflecting both my work ethic and my ability to excel across 
            a wide range of subjects. I hope to continue this trend of academic success throughout my high school career and beyond.
